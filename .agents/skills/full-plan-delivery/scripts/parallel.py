"""Conservative, pure planner for selecting independent ready work cells.

This module only plans a batch. It does not acquire locks, create isolated
worktrees, launch workers, or change any tracker state. Path conflict matching
uses literal prefixes before glob metacharacters, so it may report conflicts
between scopes that are actually disjoint. This conservative approximation
does not replace filesystem isolation or enforcement.
